# predicting_pm2.5

This project is predicting PM2.5 of some cities in Korea using a deep learning model based on multilayer perceptron. 'PM' means particulate matter which is considered as an important environmental problem.
</br>
Particulate matter can be classified into 'PM10' and 'PM2.5' along its diameter.
</br></br>
In particular, PM2.5 that has smaller diameter than 2.5Î¼m easily penetrates deep into the bronchi and lungs of the human body and causes various diseases.
</br>
Taking advantage of the characteristic of particulate matter flowing in through convection, I used some weather data.

""Jul"" :  I tried to make this model following the rules of competition of AIFactory('https://aifactory.space/task/2317/overview')</br>
""Aug"" : The competition is over, and I changed the problem and made new models.</br>
""Sep"" : Need to improve and evaluate it in many ways.
