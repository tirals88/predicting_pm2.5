# predicting_pm2.5

This project is predicting PM2.5 of some cities in Korea using a deep learning model based on multilayer perceptron. 'PM' means particulate matter which is considered as an important environmental problem.
</br>
Particulate matter can be classified into 'PM10' and 'PM2.5' along its diameter.
</br></br>
In particular, PM2.5 that has smaller diameter than 2.5Î¼m easily penetrates deep into the bronchi and lungs of the human body and causes various diseases.
</br>
Taking advantage of the characteristic of particulate matter flowing in through convection, I used some weather data.
